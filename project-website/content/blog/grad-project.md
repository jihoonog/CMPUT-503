# Grad Final Project

This is my final grad project for the course, it's an extension of lab exercise 5 where we used a machine learning model to predict single digit numbers that was trained on MNIST.
For this project I decided to run the model directly on the Duckiebot as our previous lab exercise ran the model on a laptop that was getting data from the duckiebot.

Below is the model architecture that was used to run on the duckiebot.

The video below shows our model that is running on the duckiebot in action.
